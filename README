# Snake-cms 1.0 install from tar archive for Ubuntu
####

Install apache2 web server.
sudo apt-get install apache2

Install mod-wsgi for Apache2.
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi

Install Django latest version or 1.2+ at least.
Download the latest version via svn,
svn co http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk/
and install
cd trunk
sudo python setup.py install

Install PIL
sudo apt-get install python-imaging

Go to a new directory, I use /var/django-code/.

Download snake-cms-1.0.tar.gz from snake-cms at Google Code.
wget http://snake-cms.googlecode.com/files/snake-cms-1.0.tar.gz
Unpack snake-cms
tar -xvzf snake-cms-1.0.tar.gz

Check snake-cms/cms/settings.py, at least the following lines,

It is always good to set a name and an admin mail address,
ADMINS = (
    ('Admin', 'webmaster@example.com'),
)

If you want to get a mail when someone comments you need to provide a mail server.
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'postmaster@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.example.com'
EMAIL_PORT = '25'

If you use the link portion of the cms and want the links posted to del.icio.us
you need to provide your account credentials.
DELICIOUS_USER = ''
DELICIOUS_PASSWORD = ''

Set your time zone,
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Stockholm'

Set this to a random string -- the longer, the better.
SECRET_KEY = 'SET A SECRET KEY'

If you want comments checked against Akismet for spam provide an Akismet API key.
See http://akismet.com/personal/
AKISMET_API_KEY = ''

You have to make both the directory snake-cms/db/ and the file snake-cms/db/snake-cms.sqlite3
readable and writable by your web server user. (In Ubuntu that user is www-data)

Configure apache2 to serve up snake-cms,
add the following to /etc/apache2/sites-available/default.
#Snake-cms
WSGIScriptAlias / "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/snake-cms.wsgi"
WSGIDaemonProcess snake-cms processes=5 threads=1
WSGIProcessGroup snake-cms
Alias /media/ "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/media/"
<Directory "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/media/">
        DirectoryIndex None
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
</Directory>

The login for the admin page is admin/admin123.
Don't forget to create a new user and delete the admin account.

All done.
