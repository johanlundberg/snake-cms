Requirements:

django-tagging 0.3 or later (http://code.google.com/p/django-tagging/)

If you have problems installing PIL for django-filebrowser see, 
http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/images/installingPIL.html.

How to install:
Install the required apps according to their install instructions, but se below for
suggested changes. You have to set up the paths in snake-cms/cms/settings.py yourself
if you move the django-filebrowser and tinymce files anywhere else.

django-filebrowser can be moved in to snake-cms directory and copy 
filebrowser/media/filebrowser to snake-cms/media/. 

Make the subdirectories of snake-cms/media/ writable by your Apache user.

Move tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce from the TinyMCE distribution to snake-cms/media/jscripts.

Install mod-wsgi for Apache.

Create the database and change the following lines in snake-cms/cms/settings.py to 
reflect your settings.

This should point to the snake-cms directory
SNAKE_CMS_ROOT = '/path/to/snake-cms/'
This is the URL used. The one below makes the full URL, http://www.example.com/snake-cms/.
SNAKE_CMS_URL = '/snake-cms/'
This is the URL used for the media files.
SNAKE_CMS_MEDIA_URL = '/snake-cms/media/'

It is always good to set an admin mail address.
ADMINS = (
    ('Admin', 'webmaster@example.com'),
)

If you want to get a mail when someone comments you need to provide a mail server.
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'postmaster@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.example.com'
EMAIL_PORT = '25'

If you use the link portion if the cms and want the links posted to del.icio.us
you need to provide your account credentials.
DELICIOUS_USER = ''
DELICIOUS_PASSWORD = ''

(If you need help see, 
http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/#database-installation)
DATABASE_ENGINE = ''	# 'postgresql_psycopg2', 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 'oracle'.
DATABASE_NAME = ''		# Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
DATABASE_USER = ''		# Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PASSWORD = ''	# Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_HOST = ''		# Set to empty string for localhost. Not used with sqlite3.
DATABASE_PORT = ''		# Set to empty string for default. Not used with sqlite3.

TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Stockholm'

Set this to a random string -- the longer, the better.
SECRET_KEY = 'SET A SECRET KEY'

If you want comments checked against Akismet for spam provide an Akismet API key.
See http://akismet.com/personal/
AKISMET_API_KEY = ''

Add the following lines to your Apache config:
#Snake-cms
WSGIScriptAlias /snake-cms "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/snake-cms.wsgi"
WSGIDaemonProcess snake-cms processes=5 threads=1
WSGIProcessGroup snake-cms
Alias /snake-cms/media/ "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/media/"
<Directory "[path to snake-cms]/snake-cms/media/">
	DirectoryIndex None
	Options None
	AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	allow from all
</Directory>

#This if for the admin interface
Alias /snake-cms/admin_media/ "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/"
<Directory "/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages/django/contrib/admin/media/">
	DirectoryIndex None
	Options None
	AllowOverride None
	Order allow,deny
	allow from all
</Directory>

Run python manage.py syncdb in snake-cms/cms/.
